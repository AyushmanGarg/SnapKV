Furthermore, we investigate whether instructions will affect the selection of important features even if the provided context is the same. Our experiment utilizes different instructions on the same document and selects the important features based on the observation window that consists of both the instructions and their corresponding responses. Then we calculate the hit rates between important features selected by different instruction-response pairs within the same document by using \(\mathcal{H}(\text{M}_{\text{vote\_A}}, \text{M}_{\text{vote\_B}})\). By varying the instructions, we observe that different instructions prioritize different prefix keys, as indicated by the descending trend in hit rates shown in Fig. \ref{fig: qa_pairs}.
